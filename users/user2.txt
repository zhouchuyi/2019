adding twice
refactored command wizard
return 'this like setters

looks ok given get use getnote drop generic get
add bug 123 representing bug
really want inner classes
constant somewhere
probably refactor private static string somewhere
authentication authentification sounds german
look creating egitcoreactivator egituiactivator something like egitcore egitui simplify access activators
type code screams utility method available via higher level api org.eclipse.jgit.api .. ok
'rebase-merge constant somewhere
'll file new changeset makes sense
null valid argument dircachecheckout document 'll open bug
move utility method somewhere
could move logic branchname null
remove please
may want utility method future returns refs symbolic fine
promises throw know
related change
add license header please
use configconstants add streamfilethreshold
regarding locked dircache instances please file bug track get things good enough moment
essentially duplicated code format future find way collapse code
probably use objectloader.stream_threshold make little bit mysterious looking code keep one place
looks like everything static methods static final class synchronize method arguments currently constructor
move public class 'org.eclipse.jgit.treewalk.filter package may useful clients
