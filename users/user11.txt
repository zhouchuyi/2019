currently favor require-bundle eclipse rcp world see r-b legacy pre-equinox era import-package better r-b prevent bundle running osgi environment repackaged junit i.e. bundle 'my.company.unittests provides junit testng mockito etc single bundle exports packages org.junit org.testng others +1 import-package makes reuse easier
please keep subject short common practice add preference pages snipmatch local search module include local snippets directory setting index file 9 setting ui remove useless annotate code snippets
know mean plain gerrit comment find texts change right text commit message comment 2 contains statement authorship bottom page 'comments section 'expand comments 'll find discussion marcel topic mean remove commit message may add legal stuff submitting _comment_ change press 'review button add legal statement 'cover message field submit 're done marcel told add commit message confused see told thing putting clause commit message commit messages developers primarily trying understand reasons behind specific change would mine git history find relevant commit reading helpful commit message real pleasure developer read legal stuff
would better move commit message plain gerrit comment see change https //git.eclipse.org/r/ /c/5238/ details
preferences may handled safely processes running silmultaniously two eclipse instances running workspace yes sure
would say bad default preferences eclipse-specific stored eclipse-specific locations otoh storing per-workspace makes impossible reuse repositories/indexes different workspaces disk space ability create/drop new workspaces without thinking twice online/whatsoever
ouch sorry 'll take look
markus make sense define source code formatter rules part project configuration eliminate issues future
looks bit cleaner using life-cycle mapping specific recommended btw solution 'problem unique m2e think using profile good idea available outside m2e context makes sense i.e command-line ci builds later someone integrate jacoco maven plugin m2e would change specific configuration accordingly bottom line profiles good builds outside eclipse lifecycle mapping eclipse m2e wdyt

+1 refactoring general unrelated main goal current changeset could move separate independent changeset
.internal usage gitprojectsetcapability yes default access level class constructor would better express ths fact internal use api explicitly
simple refactoring aka extract class logic different original one changes original functionality
mix fixes different problems single commit
make sense create public
constructor accepts uri parameter
return null force user *always* check null much better though
would using constants gitfetchtaskfactory introduce new dependency egit right sure bad thing add dependency vs 'magic string
constants o.e.team replace path tag project 'magic strings
could change direction dependency declare constants gituri use gitfetchtaskfactory case intent gituri class make egit-pde happy class logic dependent values
please reflect allowed comment method name
may gituri deserves test
go gituri test
make sense extract if-else aka shortening logic separate class unit test
yes maven download snapshots snapshots/enabled=true maven local repository shared many different projects -snapshots satisfy given version range maven may pick version voila unreproducibe build
style nitpick
would name smth like createfromvalidstring avoiding test* pattern
would also use single assert per test way clear one problem cause one one broken test problems asserts 1 4 test break 1 fix first 'll find another problem
good catch robin +1
nothing
anyone able create new instance reference instead gitprojectsetcapability would rather make package-level
+1 removal
sure public modifier version field represents reference implementation details doubt consumers would really interested would leave private even remove unless real usecase requires access value making private later would hard due api breakage make public later without problems
use default level method available org.eclipse.egit.core package ok. removing field line 69 obvious value expect first token removing field document explicitly somewhere keep sync etc better documentation code please leave inplace
also change introduces findbugs warning file projectreference.java line 108 type uwf_unwritten_field priority normal
populated otherwise getter useless
exactly placed todo +1 asking user clone -1 implementation pov
may itt would better start scratch 1.0 actualy first version reference format
bug gerrit displaying diff file line 5 new version please ignore previous comment
second instance 'bin.includes removed changes lines 3-4 works
please add target jre see https //github.com/manandbytes/org.eclipse.mylyn.github/commit/75b942d9263a94ed55c3747a4acdd49e319c9882 reference
one white-space-only change right
please provide specific method name seems fail due extra hostname path right
please fix whitespace errors
whitespace error
need arguments mentioned right much better commit message least
conflict markers
objectid parentid null remove else
please provide constant least text.delimiter + change-id even full change-id string like text.delimiter + change-id + change_id_regex
method contract comes org.eclipse.equinox.p2.internal.repository.tools.abstractapplication javadoc caller would expect implementations would use monitor report progress back two implementations compositerepositoryapplication mirrorapplication break contract using monitor reporting progress caller would surprised fact missing something iprogressmonitor javadoc
bad completely forgot x-friends eclipse-specific extension order safe side agree leaving method marked deprecated noticable non-pde environments ok restore method mark deprecated increasing major version segment havy change

checksumutilities decide checksums calculated need change calculatechecksums signature adding white-list checksums black-list
private boolean hasconflicts
getter actually makes sense hasconflicts private
would drop else clause smth like boolean hasconflicts isprojectinworkspace selectedprojects .getprojectname selectedprojects .hasconflicts hasconflicts hasconflicts validprojects.add selectedprojects
replacing else clause default like previous comment
sure needed works machine running linux
according https //wiki.eclipse.org/eclipse/testing using_easymock eclipse galileo release utility easymock added platform test framework

due 'origin field never read locally error see next comment
generic use case instance 've checked project fork github trying check original codebase org.eclipse using provided psf dealing two different local repositories codebase case seems unhandy would better try add new origin existing local repo fetch repository specified psf
leftover original implementation treeset-based
sure handled waiting feedback http //wiki.eclipse.org/egit/user_guide/project_set_file same_branch_vs_individual_branches
original intent define/show/discuss project reference format i.e need version like cvs 1.0|git single branch per repo vs individual branch per project args4j jsch may better way would target platform definition
remove sources mylyn sdk
remove source extra dependencies
test violates rule exactly one test fail given bug would better split 5 individual tests
good question lot java code takes style check null throws npe rather iae instead referencing lot code use npe javadoc let npe
npe make sense would better use iae
