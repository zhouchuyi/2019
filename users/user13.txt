well like mkdirs common file like operations would go create
part minimizing change filelock code wanted api'zd serious mistake fix whole locking issue next round
never thought way surely pay attention next round
actually probably made disastrous design issue giving priority port filelock easily giving priority lock simplification guess thats mistake made fix lock staff next round least try
useless think egit perspective long run conforming standard lock api benefit us using hbase appengine backend sure used might implementation difficult imho retain
agree change lockmanager
well issue lock interface throw ioexception lock lockinteruptablly needed take way documented lockable overriding done next round
agree know made trivial mistake instead make final move static initializer block
actually bit confused use switching hashmap
habits die hard thanks pointing simply vanish next round
well know unnecessary like initialize default values performance issue guess still retain
agree
unlocking go retain lock infinity commented abstract lockable
